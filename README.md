# Mutational signature dynamics across the disease course in oesophageal adenocarcinoma

## Description

This code has been developed to investigate the prevalence and dynamics of mutational signatures across Barrett Oesophagus, primary tumours and metastases is oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

## Table of contents

## **/data**
Contains relevant data files.

## **/code**
Contains the code employed in the analysis:

**MutationalSignatureAnalysis:**  
Scripts for the inference of mutational signatures and their clonality.

**PositiveSelectionAnalysis:**  
Positive selection analysis using the dndscv method for defined subgroups of the cohort.

**GenomicAssociations:**  
Script employed to link signatures with genomic markers and pathway activities.

**ModellingDiseaseStages:**  
Scripts employed for the gradient boost and multinomial regression classifiers of disease stages based on mutational signatures.

**DDRsignatures:**  
NMF methodology to infer pathway-level signatures of mutations across DDR processes.

**SignaturePrognosis:**  
Scripts employed to investigate the relation between mutational signatures and clinical outcomes.
